# Weather-app 

This project was taken from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard)

The goal was to interact with a simple [weather API](https://openweathermap.org/) through JS Promises.

Everything is written in vanilla JS, Webpack was used as a module bundler.

You can see the finished project [here](https://sim-frpt.github.io/weather-app/) thanks to Github Pages
